# Condition Handlers
Some navigation items may be dynamically generated by a custom provider based on
a database, a user's access rights or some other process. However, in other cases
and particularly for example for the DocBlock and Config there may be navigation
items that should only appear in certain contexts.

* Developer tools menus should be hidden in a production environment
* Significant areas of the navigation should be hidden if a user is not logged in
* Some areas (account registration) should be hidden when a user is logged in
* Admin areas may require that the user has an admin role.

Condition handlers allow developers to define logic for these scenarios, and should
be implemented as callbacks within a provider.

[!!] A Condition Handler does not just suppress display, it removes the item from
the navigation altogether. Condition handlers are only called during initial
compilation of a SiteMenu object - if your application context changes (for
example a user logs in or out) the SiteMenu object should be recompiled.

## Standard Condition Handlers

Class | Purpose
------|--------
[SiteMenu_ConditionHandler_Auth] | A standard interface to multiple drivers providing conditions related to user authentication and authorization
[SiteMenu_ConditionHandler_Config] | Conditions based on whether a config value is set
[SiteMenu_ConditionHandler_DateTime] | Conditions based on date and time
[SiteMenu_ConditionHandler_Environment] | Conditions based on the server environment
[SiteMenu_ConditionHandler_HTTP] | Conditions based on HTTP properties - SSL or not, originating IP, etc



## Custom Condition Handlers

Developers can easily add custom condition handlers by defining a suitable
SiteMenu_ConditionHandler_XXX class. Condition methods are public static methods
and receive two arguments - an array of information about the controller, action
and any parameters being used to map the URI, and an optional additional string
parameter.

    //application/classes/sitemenu/condition/handler/random
    class SiteMenu_ConditionHandler_Random {

        /**
         * Includes a menu item at random
         * @property array  $action
         * @property string $probability
         * @return boolean
         */
        public static function random ($action, $probability) {
            return (rand(0,100) + ($probability - 1)) / 2 >=50;
        }
    }
